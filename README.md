# Air-Quaity-Index-App
This web application predicts the Air Quality Index from given input parameters.  
The dataset is available on Kaggle on which this prediction model is built on. 
Rnadom Forest is used to predict the air quality index.  
Following are the parameters which we can change in the application and are independent variables in the dataset -  
                      "City"= Select desired 'City' from drop down list.  
                      "PM2.5"= Level of Particulate matter (PM) of size 2.5 micrometres.     
                      "PM10"= Level of Particulate matter (PM) of size 10 micrometres.         
                      "NO"= Level of nitric oxide.           
                      "NO2"= Level of nitrogen dioxide.          
                      "CO"= Level of carbon monoxide.           
                      "O3"= Level of ground level ozone.
                      "AQI" = Air Quality Index based on above parameters.  

The application is deployed on Shinyapps.io.  
Below is the preview of this application.

The application is built in reactive environment.  
After entering or selecting desired parameters you can hit 'Calculate AQI' button to find the predictions.
